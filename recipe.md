1. Heat 4 cups water in a sauce pan on a medium to high flame.
2. Add ½ teaspoon salt.
3. also add ¼ teaspoon oil to the water.
4. Let the water come to a rolling boil.
5. Then lower the flame and add 150 grams noodles. You can use instant, whole wheat, hakka noodles or all purpose flour noodles. With a fork or a spoon press the noodles in the boiling water.
6. Cook noodles on a medium flame till they become al dente.
7. Check and taste a few noodle strands and they should have a slight bite to them. They should not be completely cooked.
8. Strain the noodles in a colander.
9. Then rinse the cooked noodles very well with fresh water. Use a spoon or fork to stir when rinsing noodles.
10. when the noodles become warm or cool down, then you can use hands and lightly stir when rinsing with fresh water. Drain all the water very well.
11. Remove the noodles in a large plate or tray. Spread them evenly. Let noodles cool at room temperature for 1.5 to 2 hours. Later after 1.5 to 2 hours you can begin to deep fry them.
12. Before frying add 2.5 tablespoons corn flour (corn starch) on the noodles.
13. Mix very well so that the corn flour (corn starch) coats the noodles well. You can use a pasta or noodle tong to mix. If you use your hands, then the fingertips become sticky with the corn flour.
14. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or a pan. add a few strands of the noodles and if they come up steadily and gradually then you can begin to fry them. If they settle down at the bottom, the oil needs to get hot. If they come up too quickly then the oil is very hot, so the flame need to be reduced.
15. add noodles in batches.
16. As soon as you add noodles, then with a slotted spoon separate them.
17. fry till the base become light golden and crisp.
18. Then turn over and fry the second side till crisp and light golden.
19. Turn over a couple of times and fry till the noodles become golden.
20. Remove fried noodles with a slotted spoon draining excess oil in the kadai or pan.
21. Place fried noodles on kitchen paper towels so that extra oil is absorbed. once cooled, then place the crispy fried noodles in an air-tight container.
22. Shred or finely chop the veggies. You can use a food processor or chop the veggies with a knife. You will need ½ cup shredded cabbage, ½ cup shredded carrot, ⅓ cup thinly sliced capsicum, ¼ cup chopped spring onions, ½ teaspoon finely chopped ginger and ½ teaspoon finely chopped garlic.
23. In a small bowl, take 3 tablespoons tomato ketchup, 1 tablespoon soy sauce (i have used naturally fermented soy sauce) and ½ tablespoon sweet red chilli sauce or sriracha sauce.
24. Mix the three sauces very well with a spoon.
25. In another small bowl take 2 tablespoons corn flour (corn starch) and 2 tablespoons water.
26. then add sause
27. And mix well with your veggies
28. Now add the shredded veggies.
29. Stir the corn flour paste (as the corn flour settles down) and then add slowly in a stream in the pan.
30. Now break the fried noodles and take them in 2 to 3 serving plates or bowls. I usually break the fried noodles. You can even keep them as one whole lot of fried noodles. If you are using store brought fried noodles, then use 2.5 cups.
31. Top the crispy noodles with the sauce as required.
32. Serve veg American chopsuey immediately.
